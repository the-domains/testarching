Each property is connected to other estate and take part to shared building hosting services distributed in the village such as Spa and wellness center, pool, restaurant, bicycle storage and more, as well as the opportunity to participate with its own share in the development of the agricultural revaluation project that will make available to a productive agricultural company the land recovered around the village for the production of vegetable gardens, organic food and other recreational and educational activities that can be purchased by guests of the resort.
